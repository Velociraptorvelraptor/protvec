# ProtVec

My implementation is based on implementation by victiln: https://gitlab.com/victiln/protvec

Implementation uses word2vec family of algorithms which includes skip-gram 
(NLP context words prediction algorithms - unsupervised learning) and CBOW models
Word2vec algorithms use either hierarchical softmax or negative sampling 
optimization functions.
